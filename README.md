## ✨ Features  

- 🔒 **Secure Drug Registration**: Immutable blockchain ledger for manufacturers  
- 🔁 **Automated Ownership Transfer**: Smart contract-based secure handovers  
- 🧭 **State Management**: Track medicine journey from production to sale  
- 📱 **QR Code Verification**: Instant authentication with a simple scan  
- 🏛️ **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure  
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor the movement of medicines live  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Private Network), Solidity  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Web3 Integration**: MetaMask, Web3.js  
- **Smart Contracts IDE**: Remix IDE

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

MediChain consists of three integrated layers:  

### 1️⃣ Blockchain Network  
- Private Ethereum blockchain as the foundational database  
- Solidity smart contracts for business logic automation  
- Immutable record-keeping with timestamped transactions  

### 2️⃣ Client Communication Layer  
- Web3.js for blockchain connectivity  
- User interfaces for stakeholder interactions  
- MetaMask integration for secure authentication and transaction signing  

### 3️⃣ Application Layer  
- HTML-CSS-JavaScript frontend interface  
- QR code integration for product verification  
- Real-time tracking dashboard

## 🧩 Key Modules  

### 🔗 Smart Contract Operations  

Smart contracts written in Solidity handle:  

- `addMedicine()` – Register medicines with full traceability  
- `purchaseMedicine()` – Buy securely with automatic ownership transfer  
- `updateMedicineState()` – Update lifecycle state (e.g., Manufactured, In Stock, Sold, Expired)  
- `getMedicine()`, `getMedicineState()` – Retrieve real-time product and status info  

### 🖥️ Dashboard  

- Clean, professional interface modeled after modern commerce platforms  
- Track:  
  - 🧾 Order history  
  - 💊 Total drugs registered  
  - 📦 Total stock across batches  
  - 🏷️ Total units sold  
- Manufacturer insights, quantity analytics, and QR-based lookup tools  

### 🔍 Track Medicine  

- Search by medicine ID to view:  
  - 🧬 Batch metadata  
  - 🏭 Manufacturer identity  
  - ⏳ Lifecycle state and timestamps  
  - 👤 Current owner in the supply chain  
- One-click **Verification Report** generation for regulators or consumers  

### 🛒 Buy Medicine  

- 🔎 Live search and filter system  
- 💳 Detailed product cards with dynamic pricing  
- ✅ Integrated blockchain validation before purchase  
- ⚡ Smooth transaction flow with MetaMask authentication  

### 👥 User Management  

- Register as:  
  - 🏭 Manufacturer  
  - 🚚 Distributor  
  - 🏪 Pharmacy  
- Role-based login with Ethereum identity  
- All interactions are cryptographically signed
